              <div class="content">
                <p>
                  <br>I began my journey in the Wells Lab in June of 2020 to work on a remote bioinformatics project and process raw 16s 
                  rRNA data with QIIME 2 and produce community composition plots using Python to further the understanding of the ecology 
                  of microbial fuel cells. This sparked my interest in bio-electrochemical systems and led me to join the soil microbial fuel
                   cell (SMFC) project undertaken by the Wells Lab, <a href="http://kamoamoa.eecs.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank"> Ka Moamoa Lab</a>,
                    and collaborators from <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~cojoseph/" target="_blank"> UC Santa Barbara</a> and 
                    <a href="https://patpannuto.com/" target="_blank"> UC San Diego</a>. Our goal is to design resilient microbe-powered soil batteries 
                    to provide renewable energy supplies to distributed sensor networks for agricultural and green infrastructure monitoring, which will 
                    not only eliminate the need for potentially polluting chemical batteries but also enable the creation of fully self-sustaining IoT systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As an undergraduate researcher, I took advantage of my knowledge of renewable energy to construct a solar charging system to power outdoor 
                  data loggers for off-grid cell performance monitoring. I also contribute by leveraging 3D printing and laser cutting to conduct rapid prototyping 
                  and explore unique geometries for the cells. I previously devised models and schematics for the manufacturing of 16 SMFC scaled-up prototypes 
                  with SOLIDWORKS, and I am currently working on designing cells that can perform regardless of soil moisture levels, which we have found to be 
                  crucial to their power output. I am beyond thrilled to continue developing this cutting edge technology that I believe will one day have huge 
                  impacts on the way we power the world.

                <div class="content">
                  <p>
                  <br>While interning at CNH Industrial's NAFTA Regional Headquarter in Burr Ridge, IL, I led a project to design, prototype, 
                  and test a multi-depth soil moisture and temperature sensing module intended to be mounted on a moving tillage implement, which ultimately resulted in 3 new IP filings. This device has the
                  potential to generate high-definition 3D maps of soil moisture and soil temperature levels throughout the field, enabling farmers to adjust their operations
                  accordingly to maximize their yield. With the support of the Product Validation, Autonomous Operations, and New Holland Rapid Prototyping teams as well as my supervisors, I conceptualized 
                  and built the entirety of the sensing module from its electrical circuit and backend software to the ruggedized mechanical design of the 
                  sensor housing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the process of creating the electrical system of the sensing module, I dove deep into both analog and digital electronics and designed custom printed
                  circuit boards to minaturize the final circuit layout. Through modifying and debugging the sensors, I gained hands-on experience designing
                  sensors from fundamental physics, and improved my understanding of high frequency signals processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the software side, I utilized C++ and Python to convert raw sensor values into CAN messages that the data logger in the tractor cabin can receive, which
                  sharpened my skills in digital communication protocols (CAN, I2C), data acquisition/processing, and embedded programming with microcontrollers in general.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To design the housing of the module, I took into account the stress and torque the sensors experience as they cut through soil at high speed, and
                  used Creo Parametric to create all the 3D models and dimensioned drawings necessary to manufacture the device. This integrated my knowledge of geometric dimensioning
                  and tolerancing (GD&T), and gave me first-hand experience with sheet metal design and creating heavy-duty waterproof enclosures. I operated a stereolithography (SLA) 3D
                  printer as well as a variety of metal working tools to construct the housing out of steel and resin. After evaluating the initial prototype performance, I further improved
                  the housing's robustness by changing to a selective laser sintering (SLS) printer as the machine of choice to manufacture more rigid structures.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My time at CNH Industrial enabled me to integrate the entirety of my engineering skillset (software, electronics, mechanical) into innovating new solutions in
                  the field of precision agriculture and automation. I gained exposure to corporate R&D, and created value for the company by taking a holistic approach for this complex problem.
                  CNH inspired me to go beyond the obvious and onto the cutting edge, where I hope to remain to continue inventing new technologies that address the ever-increasing challenges associated
                  with climate change.

                Environmental Engineering Intern, <i>June 2021 - September 2021</i> <br>Bedford, IN

                  <p>
                    <br>Throughout the summer of 2021, I had the privilege of interning for General Motors at the Bedford GPS plant near Bloomington, 
                    IN where I gained first hand experience with environmental compliance in air, water, and hazardous waste and tackled large-scale 
                    sustainability projects such as GM’s Zero Waste and decarbonizing initiatives. My time working in the office, on the plant floor, 
                    and in the three wastewater treatment plants directly next to the plant taught me to appreciate the interdisciplinary nature of 
                    manufacturing and the importance of system thinking, and it also inspired me to innovate and look for solutions beyond the obvious.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By leveraging my software and workplace automation skills, I helped GM’s global Sustainable Workplaces department shortcut their 
                    annual chemical inventory workflow from an entire day of work to just seconds through building a custom Python data processing 
                    application with a complete GUI and creating the necessary training material for GM’s engineers to use the program.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By integrating my knowledge of environmental monitoring systems and microbial fuel cells, I increased the resilience of Bedford 
                    GPS and decreased the amount of labor required to ensure compliance through proposing and facilitating the acquisition of two novel
                     bio-electrochemical sensors for real-time BOD measurements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By taking a human-centered approach and a tinkerer’s mindset, I aided in the installation of exciting wastewater treatment
                     technologies through constructing 12+ standardized procedures for the operation and maintenance of a new Dissolved Air Flotation
                      mixed liquor suspended solid removal system and a self-cleaning turbidity sensor module.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    General Motors pushed me to Be Bold, Innovate Now, and Win With Integrity, and instilled in me the importance of including 
                    sustainability upstream the design process, all of which have became significant cornerstones of my engineering philosophy.
